# General

This repo corresponds to the paper `Exploiting Access Pattern Characteristics for Join Reordering` by Schubert et al. 
published at the19th International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware (DaMoN).

# Figures
For each figure, an own python script exists under `scripts/figure_scripts`. After installing the required packages 
found in `scripts/requirements.txt`, just run each scripts on the command line.
The script will run the necessary experiments and then plot the results.
